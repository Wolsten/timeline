    <p>
      As the winter season approaches and with the associated rise in respiratory ill-nesses, it feels like a good
      time
      to take stock of the data on COVID-19 and excess deaths. The following chart shows the total weekly deaths since
      the beginning of 2018 due to all causes using the official data from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk">UK
        Office for National Statistics:</a>
    </p>

    <!-- <time-line data-url="/data/weekly-deaths-in-england-and-wales-covid-comparison.json"
      data-settings="readonly=true,group=category,title=Weekly deaths (all causes)">
    </time-line> -->

    <p>We can look at the breakdown of COVID v non-COVID though we'll come back to these figures later:</p>

    <!-- <time-line data-url="/data/weekly-deaths-in-england-and-wales-covid-comparison.json"
      data-settings="readonly=false,title=Weekly deaths (with and without COVID)"></time-line> -->

    <p>The data is slightly misleading in that the COVID-categorisation didn't start until March 2020 but the two
      clear peaks in 2020 and 2021 are really clear. What is not shown is a similar peak in 2022 and we can speculate
      as to why this is the case. There are a number of non-exclusive candidates:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The vaccines programme which started in late 2020.</li>
      <li>Natural herd immunity started to kick in (delayed by lockdown policies).</li>
      <li>Many vulnerable people, particularly those over 80 and/or with pre-existing conditions had already
        passed away in the first two peaks, but one would not have expected to see a larger number of deaths in the 2021
        peak if this were the case.</li>
      <li>The evolution of the vaccine and particularly the emergence of the delta variant which, though more
        transmissable, was less serious.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One reason why I have some scepticism about the effectiveness of the vaccines is that although the programme
      began in late 2020, targeting the most vulnerable/older people, the height of the 2021 peak is
      very similar to the that of the initial 2020 peak. If the vaccines were as effective as many claim, why was the
      second peak so similar to the first (with more overall deaths) and there no obvious point of inflection? This
      question is all the more pertinent given the tighter lockdown measures introduced later in the pandemic.</p>

    <p>Of course part of the problem could be in the way the data is recorded and collected. Many people have asked for
      better data with a tighter definition of what constitutes death from COVID. There are many stories about people
      dying in hospital following car crashes. These cases were registered as dying with COVID if they had died within
      28 days of a positive COVID test. I don't want to overplay these stories, and fortunately, we have some good data
      which tries to get to the bottom of this question as a result of a Freedom of Information (FOI) request.</p>

    <!-- <time-line data-url="/data/weekly-deaths-in-england-and-wales.json" data-settings=""></time-line> -->

    <p>From the data we have looked at so far it is impossible to attribute any weightings for each possibility. That
      is not to say that vaccines were not as effective as some people thought and I would be interested if anyone
      reading post who knows of a good quality study (particularly for the UK) could leave a link in the comments. Our
      experience may not be representative but both my wife and I caught COVID before and after having the
      vaccinations. The severity of the second infection was almost as bad as the first, with the main symptoms being
      fatigue but little in the way of a cough.</p>

    <p>However, it does appear that the vaccines were not tested for their effectiveness in preventing transmission,
      as
      discussed here:</p>

    <p>I supported the proposals outlined in the <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org">The Great Barrington
        Declaration</a> which argued against lockdown in favour
      of
      targeted protection of the vulnerable. Countries such as Sweden and States such as Florida, which adopted this
      approach,
      have very similar outcomes to those which locked down hard. I don't think this is surprising given the highly
      selective nature of this virus. Also, as far as I am aware lockdown was not a feature of any pandemic plans prior
      to COVID-19.</p>
