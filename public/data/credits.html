                <h2>Our World In Data</h2>
                <span>Category: data sources</span>
                <p>As they say on their website: "If you want to contribute to a better future you need to know the problems the world faces. To understand these problems the daily news is not enough. The news media focuses on events and therefore largely fails to report the two aspects that Our World in Data focuses on: the large problems that continue to confront us for centuries or much longer and the long-lasting, forceful changes that gradually reshape our world." I plan to make extensive use of the data they have collated in order to explore issues that I am most interested in.</p>

                <p>This incredible website needs no introduction. It was invented in 2001. Although it is neither complete, definitive nor correct in all subjects, it provides an unbeatable resource for exploring a vast array of topics and when I last checked had over 55M pages!</p>

                <span>Category: data sources</span>
                <p>HumanProgress.org recognise that there is often a wide gap between the reality of human experience, which is characterized by incremental improvements, and public perception, which tends to be quite negative about the current state of the world and skeptical about humanityâ€™s future prospects. They have gathered empirical data from reliable sources that look at worldwide long-term trends hope that their website leads to a greater appreciation of the improving state of the world and stimulates an intelligent debate on the drivers of human progress.</p>

                <span>Category: climate resources</span>
                <p>Run by the Global Warming Opolicy Forum, Net Zero Watch is highlighting and discussing the serious implications of expensive and poorly considered climate change policies. It provides a clear view of the reality of climate and energy policies and what they mean for the general public. They believe that we all want to see a cleaner and better environment for future generations, but if climate and energy policies are rushed and their costs and implications not fully thought through, they will almost certainly do more harm than good.</p>
